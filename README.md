## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analytics dashboard built in **Apache Superset** to provide deep insights into auction performance. The dashboard replaces manual reporting with a dynamic, self-service tool, allowing stakeholders to track revenue, analyze sales trends, and identify key business drivers in real-time.

The layout features Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards at the top for a high-level summary. The main body consists of a grid of ten specialized charts for detailed analysis, complemented by an interactive filter panel on the left.

## ‚ú® At-a-Glance: Key Performance Indicators

The dashboard provides an immediate summary of the most critical business metrics:

-   [cite_start]**Total Lots Sold:** 50k [cite: 2]
-   [cite_start]**Total Revenue:** 754M [cite: 5]
-   [cite_start]**Average Starting Price:** 2.68k [cite: 8]
-   [cite_start]**Average Sold Price:** 833 [cite: 11]
-   [cite_start]**% Above Starting Price:** 79.87% [cite: 14]
-   [cite_start]**Average High Estimate:** 7.33k [cite: 17]
-   [cite_start]**Unsold Lots:** 26.7k [cite: 20]
-   [cite_start]**Unsold Lots Starting Price:** 2.69B [cite: 41]

##  interactivity: Guided Analysis with Dynamic Filters

<p align="center">
  <img src="[LINK_TO_FILTERS_SCREENSHOT.png]" alt="Dashboard Filters" width="300"/>
</p>

Users can perform guided analysis using a powerful set of filters, including:
-   **Start - End Date:** A date range selector to analyze specific periods.
-   **Auction Name:** A dropdown to isolate and analyze individual auction performance.
-   **Industry Type:** A dropdown to focus on sector-specific trends.

The filters are configured to be **cascading**, meaning the "Auction Name" options dynamically update based on the selected date range, providing an intuitive user experience.

## üìä Key Visualizations & Insights

The dashboard contains ten unique visualizations. Here are some of the highlights:

#### 1. US Sales Revenue by State (Geographic Map)
-   [cite_start]**Shows:** Total sales revenue generated by each US state. [cite: 101]
-   [cite_start]**Insight:** Immediately identifies top-performing regions, highlighting states like California as major revenue drivers. [cite: 101] This helps focus marketing and logistics efforts.

#### 2. Revenue by Industries (Treemap)
-   [cite_start]**Shows:** A breakdown of total revenue by industry sector. [cite: 110]
-   [cite_start]**Insight:** Clearly shows that the "Manufacturing / Production" sector is the largest contributor with 256M in revenue[cite: 110], allowing the business to understand its core market segments.

#### 3. Lots Sold Over Time (Time-series Chart)
-   [cite_start]**Shows:** The volume of lots sold between 2021 and 2026. [cite: 28]
-   [cite_start]**Insight:** Tracks business growth and identifies peak activity periods, such as the significant surges in 2024 and 2025[cite: 28], which can be correlated with market conditions or business initiatives.

#### 4. Price Range Distribution (Histogram)
-   **Shows:** The number of lots sold within different price brackets.
-   [cite_start]**Insight:** Reveals that the vast majority of transactions (374k lots) occur in the 0-100 price range[cite: 49], providing critical information for inventory and pricing strategy.

## üîß Technical Deep Dive: Challenges & Solutions

This project involved overcoming several technical hurdles that required creative problem-solving beyond standard chart configuration.

#### 1. Advanced Visual Alignment
-   **Problem:** The "% Above Starting Price" KPI needed to be visually centered, but the Superset "Big Number" chart lacks a built-in alignment option.
-   **Solution:** Used dashboard-level **Custom CSS**. I inspected the dashboard's HTML to find the chart's unique ID and applied a targeted CSS rule (`text-align: center;`) to achieve the precise visual layout required by stakeholders.

#### 2. Aggregating Transactional Data for Trend Analysis
-   **Problem:** The raw data was transactional, making it unsuitable for a "Lots Sold Over Time" trend chart without aggregation.
-   **Solution:** Leveraged Superset's built-in **Time Grain** feature. By setting the grain to "Month" and the metric to `COUNT(DISTINCT catalog_id)`, Superset's backend automatically handled the complex `GROUP BY` aggregation, efficiently converting thousands of rows into a clean monthly trend line.

#### 3. Formatting Data for Geographic Visualization
-   **Problem:** The "Sales by State" map appeared blank because the database provided state abbreviations (e.g., "CA") instead of the required ISO 3166-2 format (e.g., "US-CA").
-   **Solution:** Created a **Calculated Column** directly in the Superset dataset using the SQL expression `CONCAT('US-', state_state_short_code)`. This transformed the data on-the-fly into the correct format without altering the source database, instantly fixing the map visualization.

#### 4. Engineering Custom Histogram Bins
-   **Problem:** The business required a "Price Range Distribution" chart with fixed, 18,000-wide intervals, but the standard histogram only allows specifying the *number* of bins, resulting in unreadable ranges.
-   **Solution:** Solved at the data-source level for maximum efficiency. I engineered a **Calculated Column** (`price_bin_start`) in the Superset Dataset using the SQL logic `FLOOR(sold_amount / 18000) * 18000`. Using this pre-binned column in a standard chart solved all axis scaling and sorting issues at once.

#### 5. Implementing Cascading Filters & Ensuring Data Integrity
-   **Problem:** When filtering by date, some KPIs correctly showed "No Data." The Auction name filter also needed to update based on the selected date.
-   **Solution:** First, I diagnosed the "No Data" message not as a bug, but as a valid data integrity insight, correctly showing that `starting_price` data was missing for auctions before 2023. Second, I configured the dashboard's **cascading filter** functionality, making the Auction Name filter dependent on the date filter to create a guided, intuitive analysis experience.

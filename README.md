## üìñ Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive analytics dashboard in **Apache Superset** for an auction business. This dashboard replaces slow, manual reporting with a dynamic, self-service tool that allows stakeholders to track revenue, analyze sales trends, and identify key business drivers in real-time to make data-driven decisions.

The layout features Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards for a high-level summary, a grid of ten specialized charts for detailed analysis, and an interactive filter panel.

## üí° Key Insights & Recommendations

#### Key Insights:
* The **Manufacturing / Production** sector is the most significant revenue driver.
* Geographically, **California** is the highest-grossing state for sales.
* A high volume of sales occurs at lower price points (0-100 range), indicating a healthy market for smaller items.
* Analysis of unsold items shows which industries have the most capital tied up in inventory.

#### Strategic Recommendations:
1.  **Focus on High-Value Segments:** Double down on the Manufacturing sector by creating targeted marketing campaigns for industrial equipment, especially for potential buyers in California.
2.  **Optimize Low-Value Inventory:** Implement bundled deals or promotions for the high volume of lower-priced items to increase sell-through rates and reduce inventory costs.

## üîß Technical Highlights & Problem-Solving
This project involved overcoming several technical hurdles that required creative solutions:

* **Ensuring Accurate and Intuitive KPI Formatting:**
    * **Problem:** A critical KPI, "% Above Starting Price", was correctly calculated but displayed as a raw number instead of an intuitive percentage.
    * **Solution:** First, the SQL query was modified to calculate the pure decimal ratio. Second, Superset's built-in D3 Number Formatting (`.2%`) was applied in the chart's customization panel to visually convert the ratio.

* **Complex Trend Analysis (The Dual-Axis Chart):**
    * **Problem:** A requirement was to compare "Starting Price" and "Sold Price" trends on the same chart, which a simple line chart couldn't handle effectively.
    * **Solution:** This was solved by using Superset's "Mixed Time-Series Chart," which allows for plotting two distinct metrics against a shared time axis.

* **Aggregating Data for Time-Series Analysis:**
    * **Problem:** The raw sales data was transactional and needed to be aggregated into monthly buckets for trend analysis.
    * **Solution:** I used the chart's built-in **Time Grain** setting and a `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` metric to have Superset automatically handle the `GROUP BY` aggregation.

* **Multi-Layered Geospatial Visualization:**
    * **Problem:** The map component required the strict ISO 3166-2 format (e.g., "US-CA"), which was not available in the raw data.
    * **Solution:** I created a **Calculated Column** using the SQL expression `CONCAT('US-', state_state_short_code)` to generate the required format on the fly.

* **Advanced Custom Binning for Price Distribution:**
    * **Problem:** The business needed to see item distribution in fixed-width price intervals, but Superset's standard histogram could not create them.
    * **Solution:** I engineered the data at the source by adding a **Calculated Column** using a `CASE & END` SQL statement to pre-calculate the correct price bucket for every row.
